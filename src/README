1. Running RR with test1.txt labels multiple processes with same ID....how to resolve ties?
2. What was the RR bug?

Special Instructions:

Questions:
1. For what types of workloads does SRTN deliver the same turnaround times as FIFO?
-->

2. For what types of workloads and quantum lengths does SRTN deliver the same response
times as RR?
-->

3. What happens to response time with SRTN as job lengths increase? Can you use the 
simulator to demonstrate the trend?
-->

4. What happens to response time with RR as quantum lengths increase? Can you write an 
equation that gives the worst-case response time, given N jobs?
